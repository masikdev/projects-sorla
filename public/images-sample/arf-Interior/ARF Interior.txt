In continuation of the previous project ‘Rumah Ainur,’ this small interior design endeavor seeks to intricately express the owner’s intimate lifestyle. The objective is to create a space that resonates with the owner’s character, ensuring that visiting relatives and guests perceive the essence of the house. Specifically, Ainur Rofik envisions a well-prepared interior for family gatherings and his personal bedroom. Additionally, he desires a substantial cabinet that can also serve as storage for his clothing business.
In our design, we aim to strike a balance between semi-private areas and commercial-public spaces on the ground floor, allowing for simultaneous activities. 

However, we have introduced a unique feature on the second floor in which copy-paste from the ground a communal space designed to provide the family with a sense of privacy and intimacy, distinct from the more public areas below. By delineating between these two main categories, we have crafted a living environment that caters to Ainur Rofik and his family's daily activities, seamlessly blending private and public elements.
